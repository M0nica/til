**Static typing** involves checking types before run-time whereas 
**Dynamic typing** checks types during execution. Static typed code is generally more scaleable!

Therefore, more type errors will general surface during development with a statically typed language. Writing statically typed code is helpful to find type errors earlier as it confirms sooner whether or not you are receiving/returning/handling the expected type of data.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language however, static type checking can be implemented in JavaScript with:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- [Flow](https://flow.org/en/).
