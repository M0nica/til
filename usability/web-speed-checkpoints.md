When looking at website speed you can measure different checkpoints along the rendering process. In generaly, depending on the webpage some of these checkpoints may have more or less impact on the user experience. It is more nuanced than just looking at speed but looking at speed within the user experience context: 

1. Time to first byte
   -  How long for the first request to be made?
2. Time to first paint
   - How long for the first item to appear to user?
3. Destination Confirmation
   - How long for content that confirms destination to user to load? 
   - In other words, if a user goes to the homepage of a site -- how long does it take for the minimum elements needed to confirm that user successfully navigated to homepage to appear (i.e., logo, header, etc.)
4. Primary Content
   - How long for the content that drives and allows primary action to occur?
5. Secondary Content
   - How long for the content that drive and allow secondary action(s) to occur?
6. Above the fold content
   - How long for content in the viewable window of screen to appear?
7. Full page load
   - How long does it take for the whole page to fully load?
